Control esp32 via keyboard keys
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785400/control-esp32-via-keyboard-keys

                
I'm making a project in which I have to control a mini car and get sensor information via bluetooth. I'd like to be able to control the mini car with the computers keyboard (w,a,s,d), but I was not able to find a library that could help with that, like the "keyboard" library does ij python for example
Ex.
import keyboard

# when w is pressed, the car goes forward

If (keyboard.is_pressed("w"):

    Forward()

The "keyboard" library in arduino does not seem to work the same way. And I didn'tfind any other libraries nor tutorials about it online.
Does anyone know a way to make it work?
Any help is appreciated
Thanks ; )
    
How use a Blob Container folder in Azure ML Notebook
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785405/how-use-a-blob-container-folder-in-azure-ml-notebook

                
For a Deep Learning (Computer Vision based), I have imported a folder in an Azure Blob Container. The folder itself contains two different folders "Train" and "Test". In both the "Train" and "Test" folders I have a set of different folders according to the 9 classes of images I would like to classify.
Now, I would like to train a Deep Learning algorithm to classify to obtain a model able to classify those 9 classes and I want to use Azure Machine Learning Notebook- with the proper compute instance.
Now, when I try recalling the folder path in Blob Storage with the code:
 train_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
   r'path', #here I have to specify the path 
   shuffle =True,
   image_size =(img_height,img_width)  , 
   batch_size = batch_size             # 32)

I have to specify the path. I use a lot of different approaches, passing directly the path the services providing me but none of them work:

take the link directly from blob storage and pass it.
Create a Azure datastore a pass the Folder_URI.
Create a Azure data asset and pass it

The error is for instance:
 Could not find directory azureml://subscriptions/ data asset/images/Train

How can I pass the proper link to the folder to read the data and start training the algorithm in Azure Machine Learning Notebook?

Not able to use pod dependency in Swift static library
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785397/not-able-to-use-pod-dependency-in-swift-static-library

                
I have built a static library in Swift, which internally uses Alamofire for network connections. I have used Pods to include this dependency and my idea is that host app (that will use my library) will add Alamofire dependency in itself and my static library will use the same.
But, I am facing issue while using this library inside other app. It gives me version mismatch error.
Any help in this regard will be helpful.
    
Javascript not running in a synchronous fashion
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785401/javascript-not-running-in-a-synchronous-fashion

                
I have two functions that are inserting data into the DB. Function updateScratcherGameData inserts the game name and id into the game table. Then calls the second function, updateScratcherRowData, which inserts the raw data I scraped into another table scratcher_data. Function updateScratcherRowData needs to assign a foreign key that it gets from the game table. When I run the functions separately, they work as intended. But when I run them together, I get the following error:
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'game_id')
It appears updateScratcherRowData is running before updateScratcherGameData inserts the game_id. Can someone help me figure out what I am doing wrong?
function updateScratcherGameData(cleanData){
  
  // Insert into database games that do not exist yet
  uniqueGameData.map(e=>{
    const insertGameData = `INSERT INTO game (name,scratcher_lotto_id,gametype_id,active) VALUES ('${e["name"]}',${e["scratcher_id"]},1,1);`;

    connection.query(`SELECT name FROM game WHERE name='${e["name"]}';`, (err,rows)=>{  
      if (err){
        throw err;
      }
        if(rows.length===0){
        connection.query(insertGameData)
        console.log('insertion into game table done!');   
        }     
      }
    )})
    updateScratcherRowData(cleanData)

}

function updateScratcherRowData(cleanData){

  cleanData.map(e=>{
    connection.query(`SELECT game_id FROM game WHERE name='${e["name"]}' AND scratcher_lotto_id='${e["scratcher_id"]}';`, (err,rows)=>{  
      const insertScratcherData = `INSERT INTO scratcher_data (scrape_date,game_id,prize,odds,remaining_prize,total_prize) VALUES ((TIMESTAMP(NOW())),${rows[0]["game_id"]},${e["prize"]},${e["odds"]},${e["tickets_left"]},${e["tickets_remaining"]});`

      if (err){
        console.log('problem updating scratcher row data');
        throw err;
      }
        connection.query(insertScratcherData)
      }
    )})
  }

I tried running the functions separately and they work. Together, they do not. I tried changing where I call the updateScratcherRowData function and still get the same error

Rocksdb compaction is very slow

I am doing rocksdb compaction using compactfiles api. I checked the compaction stats, the read and write is very slow.. I am seeing the read write and write rate to be around 10MBps. which is very low.. Because my flushes are happening at rate around 330MBps.. I have set the compaction readahead size to 1MB in rocksdb options...   I have set the block cache to 10GB..  I am compacting 32 files of each size 32 MB. Do need to set any other options to increase the compaction speed?

Large binary with C++ on embedded bare-metal system (Xilinx Zync ARM A53)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785408/large-binary-with-c-on-embedded-bare-metal-system-xilinx-zync-arm-a53

                
I have an application implemented in C++ that is supposed to run on an A53 bare-metal system. My problem is that the resulting binary is very large. When I look at the content per nm I see why - there are a lot of standard C++ functions linked that I would not expect to be needed, e.g. for exception handling, RTTI and dynamic memory management. I don't use any of these.
I found this description which says that these things should be disabled with the appropriate compiler flags, e.g. -fno-exceptions, -fno-non-call-exceptions, and -fno-rtti.
Unfortunately, these have no effect at all on me - the binary keeps the same size and the said symbols are still there.
What can I do to get rid of this ballast?
    
ORA-00955 error with django migrate but no tables in Oracle database

I'm trying to deploy a Django application on an Apache webserver and Oracle DB.  When I get to trying to create the database tables using manage.py migrate  I get an error ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object.  It doesn't tell me what the object is (which is frustrating).  Looking at the database I don't have any tables in my schema.
I have run migrate more than once due to an earlier failure, but there's nothing there that I can see (I'm looking at the database in DBeaver).
I've tried SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'MYUSERNAME'; but that doesn't return anything.
Is there some way to find out what the blocking object is?  Is there some way to make migrate force its way through?  What am I missing that means I can't see the tables that the database sees?

How to digitally sign the Application.exe during publish in MAUI?

We want to publish the MAUI application after digitally signing the Application main .DLL and .EXE Files using DigiCert Hardware token certificate.
Steps we followed is:

Re-Build the Project in Release Mode
Digitally Sign the respective file of DLL and Exe present in Bin and Obj folder through DigiCert Hardware Token
Publish the project in Release Mode
During publish it has option to add Certificate, so we add the DigiCert respective certificate (so that it signs the msix file after publishing).

After Step 4 the Package (MSIX file) is successfully created with Digital Signature and ready to install.
Post installation, the Application files are present in C:\Programs Files\WindowsApps folder, over here the Digital signature is not found in EXE File i.e. Digital signature from EXE file is gets removed but digital signature is present in DLL file.
We tried with POST BUILD events also, before publishing the Digital signature is present in EXE and DLL, but after publishing the Digital signature gets removed from EXE.
Please provide your suggestions on this.

The red color is the trajectory I got, and the green is the trajectory I want. I watched many videos on this topic and all of them used either Rigidbody2D.velocity or loops. Is there any other way to do this (for example, through a dot product)?
    
Jimp returning wrong mime type
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785390/jimp-returning-wrong-mime-type

                
I wrote a bitmap parser that should return jimp object (image)
and im getting error "Unsupported MIME type: audio/mpeg"
Here's the code:
var mid = Buffer.from(mapbitmap, 'base64');
var image2 = await Jimp.read(mid);

the mapbitmap is the bitmap that im trying to parse,
it's not empty or something.
Detailed error:
Error: Unsupported MIME type: audio/mpeg

}

I don't know what to do about this,
I just started learning javascript yesterday
and basically don't know how to fix this,
It should be returning image instead of audio.

Git rebase a branch from a branch that's also been rebased
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785391/git-rebase-a-branch-from-a-branch-thats-also-been-rebased

                
Let's say I have this situation where branch1 was created from master. After a few commits on branch1, I also created another branch off of that called branch2. After this, someone else committed (D) in master. Now I want to rebase branch1 with master. But what about branch2 since branch1's hashes have been rewritten and now branch2 is lost.
master:  A - B - C - D
                  \
branch1:           E - F
                        \
branch2:                 G - H             


After rebasing branch1 on top of master, branch2 is lost because rebasing rewrites the hash of branch 1.
master:   A - B - C - D
                       \
branch1:                E - F

branch2:                 G - H             


Is there a proper way to use git rebase branch 2 on top of branch1 again in a situation like this?

HSM 9k production device power failed accidentally, I tried loading LMK onto the new HSM 9K. It reqires three components(comp 1,2 and 3) with password. Since the configiration was done 10 years ago, the password for component 2 is lost. How can i change component 2 password using component 1 and component 3. Or if there is any other work around solution. It is very urgent since it's the production device.
I tried to load the the components by uing authorization card for component 2. it accepted but the combined KCV at the end appears diffrent from the previous one.
    
Seq2Seq model- Confusing about the dimension of Seq2Seq model
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785365/seq2seq-model-confusing-about-the-dimension-of-seq2seq-model

                
I am new to Seq2Seq and hope ot find a proper guildances, advices.
I want to ask about my understanding about the architecture as well as the data dimension after each layer.

I am doing a Project from an online course so I can not give the material but I got my Project notebook on Github

Back to the question, suppose I have a Seq2Seq model as below:
Seq2Seq( (encoder): Encoder( (embedding): Embedding(5678, 512) (lstm): LSTM(512, 512, batch_first=True) ) (decoder): Decoder( (embedding): Embedding(4297, 512) (lstm): LSTM(512, 512, batch_first=True) (fc): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=4297, bias=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.2, inplace=False) (softmax): LogSoftmax(dim=1) ) )
Where 5678 is source_vocab size, 512 is desired embedding size, 4297 is target_vocab size. You can check my Encoder, Decoder, Seq2Seq class as below:
device= torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

                _, top_index= output_token.data.topk(1)
                decoder_input= top_index.squeeze().detach()
        
        return output_seq


My quesions is that the Input of Encoder is the soure vocabualry size, which mean that each token in the vocabulary should be converted into one-hot vector before parsing to the Encoder before hand (for example, should a batch has a dimension of (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size) instead of (batch_size, seq_len)?
I search others notebook and saw that they just parse a batch of (batch_size, seq_len) into the Encoder and I got confused.
Any help is appreciated.
I have tried pass (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size) and the Embedding layer output dimension is (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size, embedding_dim), which make me more confused, isn't it should be (batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim)

How to make default role array dynamic in Fuse React's role authorization system?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76785351/how-to-make-default-role-array-dynamic-in-fuse-reacts-role-authorization-system

                
We are using Fuse React template in our project. In this template the routes are generated from config files of single routes. When the generation occurs a default role array is embedded to every route. This means that if /dashboard route has a role array like ['admin','staff'] and if the user role is 'user' than this user is not granted access to /dashboard. This route generation is occuring when app first loaded.
this is where generated routes are used. its imported from the config file below.
console.log('routes: ', routes);
const App = () => {
    return (
        <AppContext.Provider
            value={{
                routes
            }}>
            <StylesProvider jss={jss} generateClassName={generateClassName}>
                <Provider store={store}>
                    <Auth>
                        <Router history={history}>
                            <FuseAuthorization>
                                <FuseTheme>
                                    <FuseLayout />
                                </FuseTheme>
                            </FuseAuthorization>
                        </Router>
                    </Auth>
                </Provider>
            </StylesProvider>
        </AppContext.Provider>
    );
};

export default App;

And this is the main config file where all the routes get their auth property embedded in.
const defaultAuth = ['superadmin', 'admin', 'staff', 'user'];

const routes = [
     ...FuseUtils.generateRoutesFromConfigs(routeConfigs, defaultAuth), //This method embeds
    {
        path: '/',
        exact: true,
        auth: '',
        component: () => <Redirect to="/login" />
    },
    {
        path: '/dashboard',
        exact: true,
        auth: '',
        component: () => <Redirect to="/dashboard" />
    },
    {
        component: () => <Redirect to="/pages/errors/error-404" />
    }
];

export default routes;

Problem: When the user logs in I get an Id from token. Then using this Id I get the arrays which shows me which routes granted access to which roles. The problem is that this routes are generated before user logs in and so I cant get an Id. I need to get the user login before route generation and using his/her Id to get role array and generate the routes based on that array. Any ideas how can I achieve this?
What did I try: I tried to move AppContext.Provider to lower levels and it didn't work of course. I expected to generate routes after authorization but since login component doesn't generated it didn't open at all.
